My Capstone project uses the Anaconda2 distribution, with
  Python 2.7.
  Jupyter Notebook 5.0.0
  
No additional software was used to create and run the models.
The models are contained in a single Jupyter notebook called capstone.ipnyb

The project is based on a DrivenData comptition, which can be found at:
